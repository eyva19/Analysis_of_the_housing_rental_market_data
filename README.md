## Using interactive visualizations, data aggregation and geospatial analysis to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.
### Housing Units
Numerical and visual aggregation were used to calculate the number of housing units per year and the results were visualized as a bar chart.
During 2010-2016 years housing units have been increasing consistently by 1947 units each year. This indicates a steady growth in housing units over the analyzed period.

In 2011 there was experience a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year, meanwile in 2011 gross rent increase compared to the previous year.

### Build an Interactive Neighborhood Map
The geospatial relationships in the data was explored by using interactive visualizations with hvPlot and GeoViews.
The higher gross rent is 3,959usd in Westwood Park (Lat 37.73415 Lon -122.457). The highest sale price per square foot is 903.99usd in Union Square District (Lat 37.79 Lon -122.4)

### Data Story
Based on the created visualizations the trend in rental income growth doesn't always repeat the trend in in sales prices. Basically, Gross Rent grew throughout 2010-2016 years, while Sale Price Per Square Foot showed both a decrease and an increase. 
Basically, some neighborhoods are more desirable than others, and this could affect the profitability of the properties. The company should also consider the demographics of the neighborhoods, as this could affect the demand for rental properties. Given the above facts, I would recommend investing in real estate in neighborhoods where there has been constant stable growth for both: Sales Price Square Foot and Gross Rent. For instance, the following neighborhoods meet the above criteria: Downtown, Eureka Valley, Forest Knolls.
